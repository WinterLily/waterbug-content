# 4. Theming

Waterbug supports customizable themes that can transform the appearance of your site without changing your content.

## Theme System

Themes in Waterbug consist of:

1. **HTML Templates**: Define the structure of different page types
2. **CSS Stylesheets**: Control the visual appearance
3. **JavaScript Files**: Add interactive elements
4. **Assets**: Icons, fonts, and other resources

## Theme Sources

Themes can be acquired from:

- Local directories
- Git repositories
- Theme marketplaces (coming soon)

## Applying Themes

To use a theme:

1. Specify the theme name in your `config.json` file
2. Add theme sources if downloading from repositories
3. Restart Waterbug or wait for the automatic reload

## Creating Custom Themes

You can create your own themes by:

1. Creating a directory with your theme name
2. Adding template files (`page.html`, `sidebar.html`, `404.html`)
3. Creating CSS stylesheets
4. Including any needed JavaScript files

Themes allow complete customization of your site's appearance while maintaining separation between content and presentation.
